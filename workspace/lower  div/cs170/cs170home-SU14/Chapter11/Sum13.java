     *  Define the method: sum13().
     *
     *  Return the sum of the numbers in the
     *  array, returning 0 for an empty array.
     *  Except the number 13 is very unlucky, so
     *  it does not count and numbers that
     *  come immediately after a 13 also
     *  do not count.
     *
     *  Some examples:
     *      sum13({1, 2, 2, 1}) returns 6
     *      sum13({1, 1}) returns 2
     *      sum13({1, 2, 2, 1, 13}) returns 6
     *
     *  @param nums the array of ints to search.
     *  @return the sum except for 13s and numbers following.
