     *  @param you the style quotient for your clothes.
     *  @param date the style quotient for your date's clothes.
     *  @return chances of getting a table (0-no, 1-maybe, 2-yes).
     *
     *  You and your date are trying to get a table at
     *  a restaurant. The parameter "you" is the stylishness
     *  of your clothes, in the range 0..10, and "date" is
     *  the stylishness of your date's clothes. The result
     *  getting the table is encoded as an int value with 0 = no,
     *  1 = maybe, and 2 = yes.
     *
     *  If either of you is very stylish, (8 or more), then
     *  the result is 2 (yes). With the exception that if
     *  either of you has style of 2 or less, then the result
     *  is 0 (no). Otherwise  the result is 1 (maybe).
     *
     *  Some examples:
     *      dateFashion(5, 10) returns 2
     *      dateFashion(5, 2) returns 0
     *      dateFashion(5, 5) returns 1
