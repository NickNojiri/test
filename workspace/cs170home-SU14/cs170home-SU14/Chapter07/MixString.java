     *  @return a new String as described below.
     *
     *  Given two strings, A and B, create a bigger string
     *  made of the first char of A, the first char of B, the
     *  second char of A, the second char of B, and so on.
     *  Any leftover chars go at the end of the result.
     *
     *  Some examples:
     *      mixString("abc", "xyz") returns "axbycz"
     *      mixString("Hi", "There") returns "HTihere"
     *      mixString("xxxx", "There") returns "xTxhxexre"
