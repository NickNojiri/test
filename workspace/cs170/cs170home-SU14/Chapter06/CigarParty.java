     *  When squirrels get together for a party, they like
     *  to have cigars. A squirrel party is successful when
     *  the number of cigars is between 40 and 60, inclusive.
     *  Unless it is the weekend, in which case there is no
     *  upper bound on the number of cigars. Return true if
     *  the party with the given values is successful, or
     *  false otherwise.
     *
     *  Some examples:
     *      cigarParty(30, false) returns false
     *      cigarParty(50, false) returns true
     *      cigarParty(70, true) returns true
