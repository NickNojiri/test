     *  Write the method named centeredAverage().
     *
     *  Return the "centered" average of an array of ints,
     *  which we'll say is the mean average of the values,
     *  except not counting the largest and smallest values
     *  in the array. Use int division to produce the
     *  final average. You may assume that the array is
     *  length 3 or more.
     *
     *  Some examples:
     *      centeredAverage({1, 2, 3, 4, 100}) returns 3
     *      centeredAverage({1, 1, 5, 5, 10, 8, 7}) returns 5
     *      centeredAverage({-10, -4, -2, -4, -2, 0}) returns -3
     *
     *  @param nums an array of int to be averaged.
     *  @return the centered average as described above (int)
