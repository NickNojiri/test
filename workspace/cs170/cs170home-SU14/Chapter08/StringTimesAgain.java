     *  Same as the stringTimes() problem except we'll
     *  use the while loop, even though for would be easier.
     *
     *  Given a string and a non-negative int n, return
     *  a larger string that is n copies of the original string.
     *
     *  Some examples:
     *      stringTimesAgain("Hi", 2) returns "HiHi"
     *      stringTimesAgain("Hi", 3) returns "HiHiHi"
     *      stringTimesAgain("Hi", 1) returns "Hi"
